Hi there,
This is the project of the landing page. 
This landing page project was built from scratch, applying all the HTML and CSS skills I acquired through the Odin Foundation. I focused on fully mastering CSS Flexbox during this process.

Noth: The images used in the project were sourced from Pinterest, ensuring they are free and copyright-free.
